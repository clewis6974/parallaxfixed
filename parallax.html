		<h1>東京、日本</h1>
      <h2>Tokyo, Japan</h2>

  <p>Tokyo, Japan was founded in 1603. Tokugawa Ieyasu establishes the first Shogunate Government in the town of Edo. This causes the Edo Period to begin. Tokyo is one of the most populated cities on the earth. With a population of 13.96 million people in 2021. Tokyo is one of the most desired places of interest for people especially in the western world. I know Tokyo is on my bucket list as one of my top places I would like to visit some day. The pictures below and above show some of the true colors of Tokyo. The top picture is the city of Tokyo in the morning, the middle picture shows one of the main temples people like to visit in Tokyo. Then the third picture shows off Tokyo's vibrant colors when illuminated by all of the lights in the city at night.</p>

  <p>In the Asakusa district of Tokyo, the exquisite Senso-ji Temple stands at the end of a long street market hosting vendors selling masks, carvings, combs made of ebony and wood, toys, kimonos, fabrics, and precious paper goods. The temple was dedicated to Kannon, one of the buddhist goddesses. It had to be rebuilt may times. The temple as you can see looks very beautiful during the day and at night we light the lanterns illuminating the true structure and art of the temple. People love visiting this temple and the street it sits on because you are able to buy Tokyo made goods and walk through the village near the temple.</p>

  <p>During the day, Tokyo is one of the most chaotic cities you can visit. The city is full of buildings and houses near. There are also a lot of street markets where vendors can sell goods and foods for everyone to buy. As you can see in this picture, Tokyo is a very vibrant city at night. People and buildings in the city display many colors throughout the night and this picture does a good job showing how truly cool it looks. People love to venture out at night and just take walks through the city and near the water. The museums and temples also look good at night when illuminated. The villages that surround the water are amazing to walk through at night.</p>
